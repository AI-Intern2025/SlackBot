SlackBot – AI-powered Slack Assistant for Data Analysis and Monitoring
======================================================================

A Slack app that analyzes natural-language requests, proposes safe SQL, executes with approval, visualizes results, and sends automated anomaly alerts to your channels.

🎯 Features

Core Capabilities

*   App Mentions → Insights: Ask questions by mentioning the bot; get SQL + explanations before execution
    
*   Human-in-the-loop Safety: Approve/deny generated queries prior to running on the database
    
*   Visual Responses: Returns charts/plots for supported analyses
    
*   Slash Commands:
    
    *   /check-anomalies — run automated anomaly checks
        
    *   /check-metric \[metric\] — analyze a specific business metric
        
    *   /create-alert \[…\] — create monitoring alerts (can open interactive flows)
        
*   Event Handling: Listens to app\_mention and interactive events
    
*   Environment-driven Config: Easily configure models, DB URL, sampling, verbosity
    

Advanced Features

*   Automated Monitoring: Scheduled checks and daily digests via a monitoring engine
    
*   Alerts to Channels: Real-time Slack alerts to configured channels (e.g., #alerts)
    
*   SQL Assist + Guardrails: SQL generation with explanations, size limits, sampling, and safe defaults
    
*   Embeddings & Similarity: Optional FAISS-backed schema/context similarity for better query guidance
    
*   Extensible Agents: LangChain-powered flows to plug in new tools and data sources
    

📱 Usage Highlights

*   Mention the bot for analysis: “@YourApp analyze daily deposits as a chart”
    
*   Run anomaly checks: “/check-anomalies”
    
*   Deep-dive a metric: “/check-metric daily\_active\_users”
    
*   Create alerts quickly: “/create-alert Track payment errors above 50 critical realtime”
    

🏗️ Architecture

Tech Stack

*   Slack: Slack Bolt (Flask adapter), Events, Interactivity, Slash Commands
    
*   AI/Agents: LangChain + OpenAI
    
*   Data: SQLAlchemy + Postgres (psycopg2), sqlglot for SQL manipulation
    
*   Monitoring: schedule/croniter for jobs and digests
    
*   Visualization: matplotlib for charts
    
*   Optional: FAISS for embeddings-based similarity/context
    

Key Components

*   app.py: Entry point, Slack events/interactions, routes (/slack/events, /slack/interactions)
    
*   agent.py: Agent reasoning, SQL proposal, human approval flow
    
*   anomaly\_detector.py: Metrics anomaly detection logic
    
*   automated\_monitor.py: Schedulers, daily digests, alert jobs
    
*   viz.py: Chart building and image responses
    
*   utils.py: Shared helpers (DB, embeddings/FAISS, SQL utilities)
    

📚 DocumentationAll setup and configuration instructions (local run, environment variables, Slack app configuration, ngrok, and troubleshooting) live in the documentation folder:

*   documentation/Project-Setup-Deployment-Guide.pdf
    
*   documentation/SLACK-APP-GUIDE.pdf
    

Please refer to those documents for end-to-end setup and Slack console screenshots.

🔐 Security

*   Keep secrets (SLACK\_BOT\_TOKEN, SLACK\_SIGNING\_SECRET, OPENAI\_API\_KEY, DATABASE\_URL) out of version control
    
*   Use least-privilege DB users in production
    
*   Rotate credentials if exposure is suspected
